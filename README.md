# Start

Welcome to my **Start** repository! This collection of code represents my programming journey from the age of 11 to 16. It's a mixture of various small projects, experiments, and learning exercises that I coded on my smartphone. Although much of it is rudimentary and some might even call it "junk," it's a testament to my early experiences and growth as a self-taught programmer.

## About This Repository

- **Purpose**: This repository serves as a reminder of where I began my coding journey. It's filled with the trials and errors of a young, enthusiastic coder who was eager to learn and explore the world of programming.
- **Contents**: You'll find a variety of small projects, snippets, and experimental code. These were my playgrounds where I learned the basics of programming languages, logical thinking, and problem-solving.
- **Development Tools**: All these projects were developed on a smartphone, using various text editors and compilers available on mobile platforms at the time.

## My Learning Journey

I discovered programming at the age of 11. My favorite algorithm in this repository is the electron configuration calculator based on proton number. This basic algorithm was developed by me after observing the pattern in electron configuration of different elements. Over the years, I learned and experimented with different programming languages and concepts. Here's a glimpse of what I explored:

### Languages Used

- **C++**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Python**
- **SVG**
- **HTML**
- ~~**Java**~~ *(404)*
- ~~**Rust**~~ *(404)*


### Tools and Editors

- **Notepad++**: I started my coding journey using Notepad++.
- **Acode**: I later found Acode, which proved to be a superior editor for my needs.
- **Termux**: For terminal-related projects involving Node.js, C++, and Python, I used Termux.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the resources that were invaluable to my learning:

- **GoalKicker**: The free programming books provided by [GoalKicker](https://books.goalkicker.com/) were immensely helpful. They served as my primary learning material due to the lack of stable internet access at the time. These books are comprehensive, easy to understand, and a fantastic resource for self-taught programmers.

## Future Plans

Now that I am 18 years old and have transitioned to using a laptop, my coding skills and projects have significantly evolved. I plan to continue learning, growing, and contributing to the programming community. This repository will remain as a nostalgic archive of my early days as a coder.
